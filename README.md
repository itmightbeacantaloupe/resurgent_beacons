AI-Based Pulsar Time-of-Arrival Estimation Prototype

Project Description
This project is a prototype that demonstrates an AI-based approach for estimating pulsar’s time of arrival (TOA) under noisy and biased observation conditions. The system simulates pulsar signals, extracts features and trains a supervised regression model to predict TOA. A classical method of TOA estimation is implemented for performance comparison.

Instructions for Launching
Requirements: Python 3.x 
numpy, sckit-learn libraries installed 
Running the Prototype Configure parameters in config.py if needed. 
From the project root directory, run main.py 
The console will display: Mean Non-AI Error , Mean AI Error , Percentage Error Reduction , Number of training samples , Feature dimension
